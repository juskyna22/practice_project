Task 4: Package the application
In this task, you have to package the final application you created in tasks 2 and 3.

Let's keep the name of the package as SentimentAnalysis. The steps involved in packaging are:

Create a folder in the working directory, with the name as the package name.

Click here for hint

You may use a terminal command or the Cloud IDE console to create the required folder

mkdir SentimentAnalysis

Put (or move) the application code, also called module, in the package folder.

Click here for hint

You may use a terminal command or the Cloud IDE console to move the `sentiment_analysis.py` file to the `SentimentAnalysis` folder

Click here for solution

mv ./sentiment_analysis.py ./SentimentAnalysis

Create the __init__.py file, referencing the module.

Click here for hint

Import the module/function from the current folder in the init file

Click here for solution

from . import sentiment_analysis

The final folder structure should look as shown in the image below.


SentimentAnalysis is now a valid package and can be imported into any file in this project.

To test this, run a python shell in the terminal and try importing the sentiment_analyzer function from the package.

Click here for the hint

from package_name.module_name import function_name

Click here for the solution

from SentimentAnalysis.sentiment_analysis import sentiment_analyzer

No error message received after import statement would indicate that the package is now ready for usage. Test the function by running the following statement in the shell.


1    sentiment_analyzer("This is fun.")

The output received would look as shown below.


To exit the python shell, type exit() or press Ctrl+Z.
