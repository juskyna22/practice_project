Task 5: Run Unit tests on your application

Since now we have a functional aplication, it is required that we run unit tests on some test cases to check the validity of its outputs.

For running unit tests, we need to create a new file that calls the required application function from the package and tests its for a known text and output pair.

For this, complete the following steps.

1. Create a new file in practice_project folder, called test_sentiment_analysis.py.

2. In this file, import the sentiment_analyzer function from the SentimentAnalysis package. Also import the unittest library.

1    from SentimentAnalysis.sentiment_analysis import sentiment_analyzer
2    import unittest

Create the unit test class. Let's call it TestSentimentAnalyzer. Define test_sentiment_analyzer as the function to run the unit tests.

1    class TestSentimentAnalyzer(unittest.TestCase):
2        def test_sentiment_analyzer(self):

Define 3 unit tests in the said function and check for the validity of the following statement - label pairs.
“I love working with Python”: “SENT_POSITIVE”
“I hate working with Pyhton”: “SENT_NEGATIVE”
“I am neutral on Python”: “SENT_NEUTRAL”

Use `assertEqual` function to compare the `label` of the output with the label expected.

1    class TestSentimentAnalyzer(unittest.TestCase):
2        def test_sentiment_analyzer(self):
3           result_1 = sentiment_analyzer('I love working with Python')
4            self.assertEqual(result_1['label'], 'SENT_POSITIVE')
5            result_2 = sentiment_analyzer('I hate working with Python')
6            self.assertEqual(result_2['label'], 'SENT_NEGATIVE')
7            result_3 = sentiment_analyzer('I am neutral on Python')
8            self.assertEqual(result_3['label'], 'SENT_NEUTRAL')

Call the unit tests.

1    unittest.main()


Now that the file is ready, execute the file to perform unit tests. Upon successful execution, the output of this file should be as shown in the image below.
